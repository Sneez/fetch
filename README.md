# Fetch Rewards Exercise

This Vue app simply displays items from a URL and displays them in a table after filtering out items with no name and then sorting by List Id and then Id.  I chose to sort by Id rather than name because the name is simply the word 'Item' and then its Id (ex. 'Item 39').  Sorting alphabetically would lead to 'Item 3' coming after 'Item 296', which I felt would be incorrect.
